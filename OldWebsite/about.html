    <p> I am a student at Clemson University who is interested in a
    wide range of subject matter; I just enjoy learning. I am set to
    graduate in May of 2018, unless I choose to persue even further
    education.</p>

    <p> Currently, I am taking a wide range of classes including... </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Design and Analysis of Algorithms </li>
      <li> Data Science </li>
      <li> Cluster Computing </li>
      <li> Computer Graphics </li>
      <li> 2D Game Engine Design </li>
    </ul>
    <p> I enjoy helping other students learn so I have been a teaching
      assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures for the second
      semester in a row now, which was one of my favorite classes that
      I have taken at Clemson so far. </p>
    <p> I also participate in programming contests, but would not
    consider that to be my focus (although I do consider them to be
    very fun). </p>
    <p> A lot of the things that I have done in my my undergrad are
    pretty varied, but have normally leaned towards research in the
    past. However, this summer I will be interning
    at <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/">BlackBaud</a> in Charleston, South
    Carolina this summer, which will introduce me more with software
    engineering. </p>
