<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1> <p>Hello people, this page is coming to you live from a server somewhere on the interweb!</p> <p>Anyways, my name is Angelo and I am a Senior Computer Science Student at Clemson. I do things and some of those things are, well, on this website.</p> <p>I like long walks in the park and most music. I also liked the work I have done in the past, which is below.</p> <h2 id="honors-thesis-work">Honors Thesis Work</h2> <p><em>2017-2018 (present)</em></p> <p><strong><a href="#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation">MORE INFO</a></strong></p> <p>Year long project with goal of improving existing techniques for hypothesis generation by extracting relevant information from research papers.</p> <p>I am working with big data (1.7 million Medical Research Articles from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>)</p> <h2 id="software-engineering-intern-at-blackbaud">Software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/">Blackbaud</a></h2> <p><em>Summer 2017</em></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="../Resources/blackbaud.jpg" /> </div> <center> <em>That is me kneeling at the bottom right</em> </center> <p>Worked on a Scrum team within an ASP.net web application, called Raisers Edge NXT, with Angular 2 on the front-end and C# and SQL on the back-end. Updated and added health pages that gave developers the tools to better analyze database health and edit database package status. Reduced the number of health pages by making a more centralized location for health data.</p> <p>Specifically, wrote JavaScript with Angular 2 Components and Services. As well as JavaScript Jasmine unit tests. On the back-end wrote in C# with SpecFlow unit tests and integration tests. Wrote basic SQL as well.</p> <h3 id="research-with-human-centered-cloud-robotics-clemson-university">Research with Human-Centered Cloud Robotics @ Clemson University</h3> <p><em>Aug. 2016 - Jan. 2017</em></p> <p><strong><a href="#/projects/pubsub_architecture_analysis">MORE INFO</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>Analyzed pubsub architectures performance in real-time environments, or simulations of real-time environments with no prediction.</li> <li>Simulations done in Mininet with python scripts for generating the network topology.</li> <li>Looked specifically at MQTT and Kafka</li> </ul> <h2 id="research-at-rutgers-university-with-dimacs">Research at Rutgers University with <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/">DIMACS</a></h2> <p><em>Summer 2016</em></p> <p><strong><a href="#/projects/multi-robot_environment">MORE INFO</a></strong></p> <p>Joined research experience for Undergrads program at Rutgers University.</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>Wrote a <a href="../Resources/finalResearchPaper.pdf">research paper</a> on results.</li> <li>Created a simulation in python, with graphics created with pygame.</li> <li>Analyze traffic in a multi-robot environment with multi-agent simulations.</li> <li>Specifically looking for sharp-transition in behavior in discretized traffic network when compared to continuous one.</li> </ol> <h4 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h4> <p>Determined through self-created simulations that there were no sharp transition in traffic, based on changes in robot size and start-end locality.</p> <h2 id="applied-algorithms-lab-clemson-university">Applied Algorithms Lab @ Clemson University</h2> <p><em>Jan 2016 - June 2016</em></p> <p>Implemented DTW Search with modifications to improve result quality with noisy signal.
