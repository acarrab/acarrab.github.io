<h1 id="ray-tracer">Ray Tracer</h1>
<p><em>Spring 2015</em></p>
<p>Wrote ray-tracer code in order to render a spaceship. The core aspects of the class were to be introduced to c++, but using additional knowledge gained through classes like vector calculus I was able to create interesting 3d structure. Also implemented texture mapping to a sphere, which is showcased in the photo.</p>
<p>The spaceship was originally created using unity 3d in order to work out orientation of the points, then ported over to a program that I wrote to convert then scale and position the element in 3d space.</p>
