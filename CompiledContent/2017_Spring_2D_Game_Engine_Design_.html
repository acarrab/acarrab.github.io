<h1 id="d-game-engine-design">2D Game Engine Design</h1>
<p><em>Spring 2017</em></p>
<p>This was a class intending on improving object oriented code quality and c++ understanding. All students worked on a semester long project with the end result of having a game being built and functional. For this task, the only tool we used other than stl was the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) 2.0</a> framework.</p>
<h2 id="my-game">My game</h2>
<p>I wanted to do something where I incorporated fun and amusing particle physics within the game. What better way to do this than to do this with a particle wizard! Using quick collision checking methods and some design patterns to improve things like speed and memory efficiency, the game is able to support the firing and handling of many particles in the system.</p>
