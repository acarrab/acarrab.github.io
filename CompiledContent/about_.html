<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>Computer Science Major, Mathematical Sciences Minor</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>I started out at Clemson University on a pre-med and computer science track; However, saw the impact and outreach that was achievable through computer science (as well as the fun projects!). I also have enjoyed mathematics—it originally pushed me towards computer science—and also believe that it is very relevant to a lot of computer science.</p>
<p>I plan on going to graduate school and applying/developing my skills in order to contribute to the progression of the medical field or any other field where the result seems to be overwhelmingly beneficial.</p>
<p>I enjoy working with algorithm design, machine learning, and <a href="#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation">big data</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/OldWebsite">Websites</a> and other computer graphics related applications are fun as well.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Some of the projects that I worked on in the past were medically oriented. The current one being worked on is described in depth <a href="#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation">here</a>. The other, worked on sophomore year, was a smaller sized project in which I helped with the implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping">dynamic time warping</a> for searching for signals efficiently in a database of EEG records.</p>
<p>Other projects were mostly for exploration into different topics within computing, like a <a href="#/projects/pubsub_architecture_analysis">networking research project</a> that I helped with. For most of the school projects that I do, I enjoy them and do a bit of extra work for them. The projects that I included were those that nice visual outputs at the end. Namely: <a href="#/school_work/2017_Spring_2D_Game_Engine_Design">2D Game Engine Design</a>, <a href="#/school_work/2017_Spring_Computer_Graphics">Computer Graphics</a>, and an older <a href="#/school_work/2015_Spring_102_RayTracer">Ray Tracer Project</a>.</p>
<p>I would include other projects and code as well, but fear the wrath of professors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation">MORE INFO</a></strong></p>
<p>Year long project with goal of improving existing techniques for hypothesis generation by extracting relevant information from research papers.</p>
<p>I am working with big data (about 100gb in textual data or 1.7 million Medical Research Articles from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>)</p>

<p>Blackbaud is a company that creates software tailored for nonprofit organizations. The most used product is Raiser's Edge, which is used by nonprofits when determining how to most effectively handle their donors.</p>
<p>Worked on a Scrum team within an ASP.net web application called Raisers Edge NXT—which makes up about 30% of their sales. I worked with Angular 2 on the front-end and C# and SQL on the back-end. Updated and added health pages that gave developers the tools to better analyze database health and edit database package status. Reduced the number of health pages by making a more centralized location for health data.</p>
<p>Specifically, wrote JavaScript with Angular 2 Components and Services. As well as JavaScript Jasmine unit tests. On the back-end wrote in C# with SpecFlow unit tests and integration tests. Wrote basic SQL as well.</p>
