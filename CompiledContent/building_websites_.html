<h1 id="my-website">My Website</h1>
<p><strong>Built with react, autogenerated from markdown documents and directory structure, with bootstrap layered on top of it</strong></p>
<p>This website is compiled and then statically served, which makes it good for use on any web server. I know now that there is <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, but I enjoyed the process of putting all this together.</p>
<p>All the html that is presented before you, is generated directly from the directory layout of files. Directories are turned into drop-down menus. (This does however become difficult when it is a multi-level drop-down, which I plan to have if time allows)</p>
<p>Code is on <a href="https://github.com/acarrab/acarrab.github.io">Github</a></p>
<h2 id="there-was-also-my-other-website">There was also my other website</h2>
<p>This <a href="/OldWebsite">older website</a> was built for fun and from a low level. I think it is really fun to travel around though! I made <strong><em>interesting</em></strong> design choices though...</p>
<p>I would have kept using this, if it wasn't for the need to have good mobile support.</p>
