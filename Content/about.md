# About me

## Interests

I started out at Clemson University on a pre-med and computer science track; However, saw the impact and outreach that was achievable through computer science (as well as the fun projects!). Since then, I have made myself much more oriented towards computer science and mathematics as it seems that the two fields should almost go hand in hand.

Some of the projects that I worked on in the past were medically oriented. The current one being worked on is described in depth [here](#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation). The other, worked on sophomore year, was a smaller sized project in which I helped with the implementation of dynamic time warping for searching for signals efficiently in a database of EEG records.

Other projects were mostly for exploration into different topics within computing, like a [networking research project](#/projects/pubsub_architecture_analysis) that I helped with. Most of the school projects that I do, I enjoy and do a bit of extra work on them as well. The projects that I included were those that nice visual outputs at the end. Namely: [2D Game Engine Design](#/school_work/2017_Spring_2D_Game_Engine_Design), [Computer Graphics](#/school_work/2017_Spring_Computer_Graphics), and an older [Ray Tracer Project](#/school_work/2015_Spring_102_RayTracer)

I plan on going to graduate school and applying/developing my skills in order to contribute to the progression of the medical field or any other field where the result seems to be overwhelmingly beneficial.

I enjoy working with algorithm design, machine learning, and [big data](#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation).

[Websites](/OldWebsite) and other computer graphics related applications are fun as well.

## Projects
### Honors Thesis Work

*2017-2018 (present)* 

**[MORE INFO](#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation)**

Year long project with goal of improving existing techniques for hypothesis generation by extracting relevant information from research papers.

I am working with big data (about 100gb in textual data or 1.7 million Medical Research Articles from [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/))

### Software engineering intern at [Blackbaud](https://www.blackbaud.com/)

*Summer 2017*

Blackbaud is a company that creates software tailored for nonprofit organizations. The most used product is Raiser's Edge, which is used by nonprofits when determining how to most effectively handle their donors.

Worked on a Scrum team within an ASP.net web application called Raisers Edge NXTâ€”which makes up about 30% of their sales.
I worked with Angular 2 on the front-end and C# and SQL on the back-end. Updated and added health pages that gave developers the tools to better analyze database health and edit database package status. Reduced the number of health pages by making a more centralized location for health data.

Specifically, wrote JavaScript with Angular 2 Components and Services. As well as JavaScript Jasmine unit tests. On the back-end wrote in C# with SpecFlow unit tests and integration tests. Wrote basic SQL as well.

### Research with Human-Centered Cloud Robotics @ Clemson University

*Aug. 2016 - Jan. 2017* 

**[MORE INFO](#/projects/pubsub_architecture_analysis)**

- Analyzed pubsub architectures performance in real-time environments, or simulations of real-time environments with no prediction.
- Simulations done in Mininet with python scripts for generating the network topology.
- Looked specifically at MQTT and Kafka

### Research at Rutgers University with [DIMACS](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/)

*Summer 2016* 

**[MORE INFO](#/projects/multi-robot_environment)**

Joined research experience for Undergrads program at Rutgers University.

1. Wrote a [research paper](../Resources/finalResearchPaper.pdf) on results.
1. Created a simulation in python, with graphics created with pygame.
1. Analyze traffic in a multi-robot environment with multi-agent simulations.
1. Specifically looking for sharp-transition in behavior in discretized traffic network when compared to continuous one.

#### Takeaway

Determined through self-created simulations that there were no sharp transition in traffic, based on changes in robot size and start-end locality.

### Applied Algorithms Lab @ Clemson University

*Jan 2016 - June 2016*

Implemented DTW Search with modifications to improve result quality with noisy signal.
For EEG database to add search functionality for Neurologists at MUSC research hospital.

### Virtual Environment Group @ Clemson University

*Sep. 2014 - Aug. 2015*

Research Assistant C Designed computer vision software in C, OpenGL,
and GLUT.
Worked on software for calibrating camera image distortion through analysis of an image of a checkered board.
Created edge detection processing.
