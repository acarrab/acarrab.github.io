# Angelo Carrabba

Hai people, this page is coming to you live from a server somewhere on the interweb!

Anyways, the name is Angelo and I am a Senior Computer Science Student at Clemson.
I do things occasionally, but really just like messing around with random things for fun.

I like long walks in the park and most music.

### Software engineering intern at [Blackbaud](https://www.blackbaud.com/)
![](../Resources/blackbaud.jpg)

*Summer 2017*

Worked as a full-stack software engineering intern and developed things with JavaScript, Angular, JQuery, C#, and SQL.

### Research with Human-Centered Cloud Robotics @ Clemson University

*Aug. 2016 - Jan. 2017*

- Analyzed pubsub architectures performance in realtime environments, or well realtime simulations.
- Simulations done in Mininet with python scripts for generating the network topology.
- Looked specifically at MQTT and Kafka

### Research at Rutgers University with [DIMACS](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/)

*Summer 2016*

Joined research experience for Undergrads program at Rutgers University.

1. Wrote a [research paper](../Resources/finalResearchPaper.pdf) on results.
1. Created a simulation in python, with graphics created with pygame.
1. Analyze traffic in a multi-robot environment with multi-agent simulations.
1. Specifically looking for sharp-transition in behavior in discretized traffic network when compared to continuous one.

#### Takeaway

Determined through self-created simulations that there were no sharp transition in traffic, based on changes in robot size and start-end locality.

### Applied Algorithms Lab @ Clemson University 

*Jan 2016 - June 2016*

Implemented DTW Search with modifications to improve result quality with noisy signal.
For EEG database to add search functionality for Neurologists at MUSC research hospital.

### Virtual Environment Group @ Clemson University 

*Sep. 2014 - Aug. 2015*

Research Assistant C Designed computer vision software in C, OpenGL,
and GLUT.
Worked on software for calibrating camera image distortion through analysis of an image of a checkered board.
Created edge detection processing.
