# About me

Computer Science Major, Mathematical Sciences Minor

## Interests

I started out at Clemson University on a pre-med and computer science track; However, saw the impact and outreach that was achievable through computer science (as well as the fun projects!). I also have enjoyed mathematics—it originally pushed me towards computer science—and also believe that it is very relevant to a lot of computer science.

I plan on going to graduate school and applying/developing my skills in order to contribute to the progression of the medical field or any other field where the result seems to be overwhelmingly beneficial.

I enjoy working with algorithm design, machine learning, and [big data](#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation).

[Websites](/OldWebsite) and other computer graphics related applications are fun as well.

## Past work summary

Some of the projects that I worked on in the past were medically oriented. The current one being worked on is described in depth [here](#/projects/topic_modeling_and_hypothesis_generation). The other, worked on sophomore year, was a smaller sized project in which I helped with the implementation of [dynamic time warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) for searching for signals efficiently in a database of EEG records.

Other projects were mostly for exploration into different topics within computing, like a [networking research project](#/projects/pubsub_architecture_analysis) that I helped with. For most of the school projects that I do, I enjoy them and do a bit of extra work for them. The projects that I included were those that nice visual outputs at the end. Namely: [2D Game Engine Design](#/school_work/2017_Spring_2D_Game_Engine_Design), [Computer Graphics](#/school_work/2017_Spring_Computer_Graphics), and an older [Ray Tracer Project](#/school_work/2015_Spring_102_RayTracer).

I would include other projects and code as well, but fear the wrath of professors.
