#### Databases

In databases, we are emulating the functionality of YouTube, but doing
so with the use of ReactJs and Typescriptand using PHP for the
backend.


#### WSBF FM Clemson Radio Station: Amalgam

This project works on automation and dj music selection for playing of
music playing for our radio station. However, the current Databases
project takes some priority. This project is in its early stages.



## Past Work

### Current Website

**Built with react, autogenerated from markdown documents and
directory structure, with bootstrap layered on top of it**

All the html that is presented before you, is generated directly from
the directory layout of files. Directories are turned into drop-down
menus.

Code is on [Github](https://github.com/acarrab/acarrab.github.io)

### First Website

This [older website](/OldWebsite) was built for fun and from a low
level. I think it is really fun to travel around though! I made
***interesting*** design choices...
