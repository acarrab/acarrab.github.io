## Teapot with Rendering Equation approximation

*Late Spring 2016*

This project was done in order to approximate the light scattering effects that occur within real-world environments.

Using [Radiosity equations](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-10/lectures/renderingequation/renderingequation.pdf) and randomized sampling around spheres according approximate things like light scatter as well.

### Result

## Stanford Bunny

*Early Spring 2016*

For this project, our group worked with the classic stanford
bunny and applied some of our newly learned knowledge in computer
graphics to generate a model of the bunny and make it look pretty.

In hindsight, the motion blur was too much :(
