# Ray Tracer

*Spring 2015*

Wrote ray-tracer code in order to render a spaceship. The core aspects of the class were to be introduced to c++, but using additional knowledge gained through classes like Multi-Variable calculus, I was able to create unique 3d structures. Also implemented texture mapping to a sphere, which is showcased in the photo.

### Result
