## Projects

### Data Mining Research and Project @ Clemson University

*Fall 2017 â€” Spring 2018 (present)*

- Comparing research papers' abstracts (only) and full-texts (including abstracts) as data input for hypothesis generation algorithm.
- Will work on increasing quality of abstract by extracting relevant data from full-texts.
- Worked with large data input (over 1 million documents; over 30gb of textual data).

### Research Assistant within Human-Centered Cloud Robotics @ Clemson University

*Fall 2016*

- Analyzed pubsub architectures performance in real-time environments through MiniNet simulations.
- Created network topologies then simulations in python.
- Collected data then created graphs and plots to analyze difference in performance of MQTT and Kafka.

### REU Program @ Rutgers University with DIMACS

*Summer 2016* 

- Studied agent interaction in multi-agent environment.
- Created simulations in python with graphical representation using pygame.
- Developed imperfect path planning algorithm in order to monitor traffic increases within environment parameter changes.
- Discretized environment with degree of optimality constituted by maximal density within representation.
- Collected data, created graphs, and compared results.
- Wrote a [research paper](../Resources/finalResearchPaper.pdf) on results.
