# Honors Research Project for Senior Year

This project is a school year long project in which I am working along side grad students in the ACS (Algorithms and Computational Sciences Lab). I am adding to the work being done by [Justin Sybrandt](http://sybrandt.com/) by determining if we can increase the accuracy of Molier, his hypothesis generation algorithm.

We are seeing if it helps to extract additional information from the full-texts and if so, how to best do so.
