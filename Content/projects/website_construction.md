# My Website

**Built with react, autogenerated from markdown documents and directory structure, with bootstrap layered on top of it**

This website is compiled and then statically served, which makes it good for use on any web server or application setting.
I know now that there is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but I think that this gives me a bit more control and I get to use react which is almost always fun.

All the html that is presented before you, is generated directly from the directory layout of files. Directories are turned into drop-down menus. (This does however become difficult when it is a multi-level drop-down, which is what I would work on if I had the time)

Anyways, this code will be on github at some location.
I would talk more about this right now, but it is 3 in the morning and writing will be poop.
