# My Website

**Built with react, autogenerated from markdown documents and directory structure, with bootstrap layered on top of it**

This website is compiled and then statically served, which makes it good for use on any web server.
I know now that there is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but I enjoyed the process of putting all this together.

All the html that is presented before you, is generated directly from the directory layout of files. Directories are turned into drop-down menus. (This does however become difficult when it is a multi-level drop-down, which I plan to have if time allows)

Code is on [Github](https://github.com/acarrab/acarrab.github.io)

## There was also my other website

This [older website](/OldWebsite) was built for fun and from a low level. I think it is really fun to travel around though! I made ***interesting*** design choices though...

I would have kept using this, if it wasn't for the need to have good mobile support.
